I'm a programmer, father of two boys, cookbook collector, Pokemon trainer, and video game enthusiast.  

I started this food blog to share my favorite receipes and mistakes.  I just started eating steak medium, shrimp, and seafood in general.  I'm slowly becoming a less picky eater but still think sweet potatoes are vile.

My favorite thing growing up was making food with my grandma and listening to her food mistakes.  I started sharing these stories with my son while we make pizza, cookies, tamales, etc.
