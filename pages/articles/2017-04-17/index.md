I'm very lucky to have a wife that is a stay-at-home mother.  Becase of this, she ends up making our meals throughout the work week.  Once and awhile she will get fancy and makes tortillas.

About two years ago she started making tamales and tortillas in our new home.  We get the instant masa, comes in a 4 pound bag, you can get this at most Meijer or Ultra.  Just follow the instructions on the bag usually 1:1 masa water ratio.  I normally add 1-2 tbsp more salt.  Once made, take a piece of parchment paper, spray with oil, place spoon of masa in and press.  To cook, place on heated skillet and cook for 30 seconds on both sides.  Once you do a dozen or two, you can heat them up on the stove top fire.

Next time Diane makes tortillas, I'll get pictures or video of how to make masa, pressing them, and cooking process.
