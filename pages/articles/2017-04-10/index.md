I make the pizza dough usually in the morning for dinner time.  Once manipulating the dough, allow 30 minutes before being used to get it to relaxed. 

# Ingredients
* 2 cups of bread flour
* 2 cups of AP flour
* 1 envelope of instant dry yeast (I get the 3 pack from Aldi)
* 3 tsp of salt
* 3 tbsp of garlic powder
* 3 tbsp of onion powder
* 1 1/2 cups of water (110 degrees)
* 2 tbsp of olive oil

# Instructions
* Proof your yeast in cup of water for 10 minutes
* Sift the flour into your mixer
* Add salt, garlic powder, and onion powder
* Mix the ingredients for one minute on low/med speed
* Slowly add your cups of water
* Add olive oil after water has been mixed in
* Add water/flour if it's to wet or dry
* Pre-heat oven to the highest setting - mine goes to 500'
* Leave pizza stone in oven to get nice and hot!
* Transfer created pizza onto your pizza stone for 12-15 minutes

Enjoy!
