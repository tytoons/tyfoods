Off and on for the past two years, I have been trying to perfect my pizza dough.  I started off with classic Bobby Flays' dough but it's not exactly what I want.

Don't get me wrong, it's delicious but I'm looking for a pizza that doesn't rise so much in the oven.  I tried slow rise in the fridge, half yeast, corn meal bottom, but everything comes up subpar.
